* ### Machine Learning Projects
  * [ML with Linear Regression](https://github.com/Abhay-Joseph7/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/ML%20with%20Linear%20Regression) - A model to predict canada's per capita income in year 2020 using the data set [canada_per_capita_income](https://github.com/Abhay-Joseph7/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/ML%20with%20Linear%20Regression/canada_per_capita_income.csv). This model uses linear regression from the sklearn library.
  * [ML with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Abhay-Joseph7/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/ML%20with%20Logistic%20Regression) - A model to identify Handwritten digits using the data set [load_digits from sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_digits.html). This model uses logistic regression from the sklearn library.
  * [ML with Decision Tree](https://github.com/Abhay-Joseph7/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/ML%20with%20Decision%20Tree) - A model to titanic survivors using the data set [titanic.csv](https://github.com/Abhay-Joseph7/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/ML%20with%20Decision%20Tree/titanic.csv). This model uses DecisionTree from the sklearn library.
   * [ML with Random Forest](https://github.com/Abhay-Joseph7/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/ML%20with%20Random%20Forest) - A model toPredicting Iris Flower Species using the data set [load_iris from sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html). This model uses RandomForest from the sklearn library.
